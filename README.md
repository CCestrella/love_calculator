# ðŸ’˜ Love Calculator


The **Love Calculator** is a fun and interactive desktop application built with Python and the Tkinter library. It lets users input two names and calculates a "love score" based on the occurrences of specific letters. Depending on the score, a unique message is displayed to show the compatibility between the two names.
